Eatable makes cooking simple by allowing users to store all of their recipes in one place. With Eatable's hashtag feature, users can easily organize, search, and share their recipes without sifting through cookbooks or food blog links. Users can also create a Grocery List from their recipe ingredients, and have that list texted to them.

## How to Use Eatable

###### Eatable has an intuitive, clean UI

![Homepage](http://g.recordit.co/9wie3PhF4f.gif)  
<br><br>
###### Search your recipes based on a recipe title, ingredient, or hashtag. The typeahead.js plugin will make suggestions for you. Your search triggers an AJAX request, which quickly displays ranked results thanks to PostgreSQL's powerful search features.

<br><br>
###### Adding a recipe is simple. Include as many ingredients as you want--the fields just get duplicated with Javascript's `clone()` method.

<br><br>
###### Adding a recipe's ingredients to your cart can be done with a click. The recipe's ingredients are added to an association table in the database, and displayed with Jinja.

    * `psql`
    * `CREATE DATABASE eatabledb;`
  * Create the tables in your database:
    * `python -i model.py`
    * While in interactive mode, create tables: `db.create_all()`
